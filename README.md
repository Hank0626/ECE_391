# ECE391 Computer System Engineering Course Machine Problems
This repository contains the machine problem (mp) assignments for the ***ECE391 Computer System Engineering*** course at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

## MP0: Setting Up the Environment
[MP0](./mp0/) provides students with instructions on how to set up their environment for the ECE391 Computer System Engineering course. This includes configuring the course machine, installing the necessary software and libraries, and setting up the development environment.

## MP1: RTC Driver Program in x86 Assembly Language
[MP1](./mp1/) requires students to write a program in x86 assembly language that interacts with the RTC (Real Time Clock) driver. The program must be able to read the time from the RTC and display it in a specific format. Additionally, students must implement a system call that allows user-level programs to access the RTC functionality.

## MP2: Maze Exploration Game in C Language
[MP2](./mp2/) involves writing a maze exploration game in C language. The game should allow the user to navigate through a maze and find the exit. Students must also implement a character that can move through the maze and interact with various objects.

## MP3: Operating System Kernel
MP3 involves writing an operating system kernel for Linux. The [mp3_master](./mp3_master/) directory contains the basic requirements for the operating system kernel, while the [mp3_extra](./mp3_extra/) directory includes additional features such as boot animation, GUI module, and dynamic allocation module. Our operating system is named LLL OS.

Here is the demo of our [LLL OS](./mp3_extra/):
